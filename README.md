The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

Download the zip file from this URL https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Unzip the file in the working directory. It will creates a folder "UCI HAR Dataset".

Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R). Note that it requires the reshape2 package, which can be downloaded from CRAN.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv.

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
